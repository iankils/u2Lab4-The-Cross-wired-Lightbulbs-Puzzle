# Prompt
The goal is simple, turn on all the lights! That would be simple if every switch turned on the single light that was above it. However, almost every switch in this lab does just the opposite of what you would expect. First, you'll have to do something evil and program the lights to be mismatched, then you will try to get all of them on. After, in the extensions, there will be some fun ways to spice up the challenge.

## Directions 
Utilize the Starter Code. There are 9 lights as numbered in the image below. The steps below will guide you to connect switch 1 with light 3 and light 8. Then, follow the same pattern to connect the other switches as indicated below.

1. Let's connect the first switch. This can be broken down into 3 steps:
  - use `querySelector()` to get the element of the 1st switch with an `id="switch1"`,
  - create a function that uses `querySelector()` to get the element of light 3 and 8 (with `id="lightbulb3"` and `id="lightbulb8"`) and switch their current state. In other words, if the light is on turn it off, and if it's off then turn it on,
  - use `addEventListener()` to call the function when the switch is "flicked"

2. First, use `querySelector()` to get the element of the 1st switch. Save it into a variable called "switch1". It should look as follows:
```
const switch1 = document.querySelector("#switch1");
```

3. Next, create a function called change38 and get the elements for lightbulb 3 and 8.
```
const change38 = () => {
    const light3 = document.querySelector("#lightbulb3");
    const light8 = document.querySelector("#lightbulb8");
}
```

4. Then, in that same function, use add and remove or toggle to switch the attribute **"active"**. There's more than 1 right way to do this. Just make sure you switch both lights!

5. Finally, add an event listener for the switch that calls the function change38.
```
switch1.addEventListener('change', change38);
```

6. Now, continue to route lights as indicated below
  - switch1: lightbulb3, lightbulb8
  - switch2: lightbulb1, lightbulb7
  - switch3: lightbulb4, lightbulb6, lightbulb8
  - switch4: lightbulb2, lightbulb9
  - switch5: lightbulb5
  - switch6: lightbulb1, lightbulb4
  - switch7: lightbulb2, lightbulb3
  - switch8: lightbulb5, lightbulb9
  - switch9: lightbulb6, lightbulb7

7. Great, you did it! If you did it right, all your switches should be... wrong. Switch #5 should be the only switch working correctly. Take a moment to try and get all the lights to turn on!

## Extensions
### Mild

- `switch5` makes the puzzle too easy. Change it so that it changes 5 and any other lightbulb except 9. For example, 7: the switch should then call `change57` and the old function should now toggle both *light #5* and *light #7*.

### Medium

- Add a master switch that toggles all the lights. The switches should be left in their current state.
- Add a "restart" button that turns all toggles orange and all lights off.

### Spicy

- Add a "randomize" button that restarts the game and turns on 3 random lights (all toggles should be orange). HINT: use [Math.random()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random) and some `if else` statements to determine which lights will be initialized to `on`.

- Let **green** `rgb(0, 255, 0)` be the color of success in this game aka when all 9 lights are on. Let **purple** `rgb(255, 0, 255)` be the color from when the game starts.
  - Go into the `style.css` and change the background to the purple RGB. The property is in the ruleset for the id `#wrapper`.
  - In the `script.js`, code it so that every time a light goes on, the R and B values drop by 28, and the G value increases by 28. (For example: from `rgb(255, 0, 255)` to `rgb(227, 28, 227)`)
  - When ever a light goes off, the opposite should happen. (For example: `rgb(143, 112, 143)` to `rgb(171, 84, 171)`)
  - If you do this correct, the color should switch from purple to gray (when the puzzle is half way complete) to green.
